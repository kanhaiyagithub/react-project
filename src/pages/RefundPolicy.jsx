      <p>
        At Social Viral, we strive to ensure a smooth and satisfactory service
        experience for all users. Our digital growth services are delivered
        through automated systems designed to fulfill orders promptly and
        accurately based on the details you provide. Because each service begins
        processing immediately after a purchase is confirmed, our refund policy
        is structured to maintain fairness while addressing genuine issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        Refunds may be issued in circumstances where the service you purchased
        was not delivered, partially delivered, or failed due to technical
        errors originating from our side. If your order remains incomplete or
        undelivered, you must contact our support team within 30 calendar days
        of purchase to request a refund. Our team will review the request and
        notify you of approval or denial within 3–5 business days. Approved
        refunds are processed to the original payment method and may take
        7–10 business days to reflect depending on your bank or payment
        provider’s processing time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Refunds are not applicable once a service has been fully delivered or
        successfully initiated. Additionally, no refund will be issued in cases
        where incorrect account details were provided, the user changed their
        social media username during processing, set their profile to private,
        or took actions that disrupt delivery. Refunds are also not provided for
        promotional packages, free credits, or services used in violation of our
        Terms of Service.
      </p>

      <p>
        Filing false chargebacks or disputes through banks or payment gateways
        is strictly prohibited. If a fraudulent dispute is filed, Social Viral
        reserves the right to revoke previously delivered services, suspend the
        associated account, and permanently restrict access to the platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        For any issues related to incomplete orders, service delays, or quality
        concerns, users must contact our support team directly before initiating
        any dispute with a financial institution. Our dedicated team is ready to
        assist and resolve concerns quickly and professionally.
